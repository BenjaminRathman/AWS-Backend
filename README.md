We have only been thinking about userside we also need a login side for the bar so they can input things

possible name: Bar Buddy?

Deliverable idea pre-ordering drinks with an integrated loyalty system 

## MVP

# UI - 

Page 1 (info page) 

based on selected location the user sees:
info about daily specials at partnered bars 
maybe the bar comes to us to promote a one time special (maybe we charge here)

page 2 
The user sees all partnered bars 
when user clicks on a bar the user sees list of drinks that can be bought before the bar opens at a discount?

Then there is a max amount of points that the user can get per bar (resets everyday) this can then be redeemed for a free drink (loyalty program)


# auth0 for login 

# Stripe to handle transactions
