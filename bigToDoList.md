# - Here is a list of everything that need to be done write down all thoughts and ideas this will all be cleaned and made "nice" tomorrow.

## - List 

We need to figure out what infrasture we are doing:
    -First we need to know what we actually need(server, database, api, auth0, stripe, etc)
    - ^to do this we need to better understand what we are building 
    - ^Once all of this is done, we need to create an infrastructure diagram.

List out what the MVP is going to look like(both actually look like (ui) and features (what it will do))

Reach out to businesses this would help and get feedback:
    - ^this is going to require a well thought out pitch 
    - ^it likely makes sense to do market research (look at other implementations to see if we can gauge possible returns)
